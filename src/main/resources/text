Valentine’s Day, a festival of romantic love and care, is celebrated on the 14th of February.

This old festival has taken a great importance in recent years.
But Valentine’s Day is not considered as a public holiday in the USA.
It means that stores, schools and different organizations work as usual.

People give small gifts or they exchange cards and love letters that express their feelings. The small present can be a bunch of flowers, chocolate, a teddy bear or jewelry and a dinner in a restaurant.
It really depends on the people, their tastes, imagination and financial opportunities.
